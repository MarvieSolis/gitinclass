    <p>
        My name is Marvie Solis. I am from Carson, CA and I currently reside in Orange, CA. <br>
        I work as a Service Tech for The Irvine Company and I am also a recent graduate from UCI. <br>
        I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering with a 2.9 GPA. <br>
        As hobbies, I enjoy dancing, DJing, working on my car, and playing video games.
        I am a dancer in the dance team, Kaba Modern, which is based in Irvine, CA.<br>
        My current project car is a Scion FRS. I have spent thousands of dollars on it so far. <br>
